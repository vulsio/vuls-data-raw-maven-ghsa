	"summary": "The redirect_uri validation logic allows for bypassing explicitly allowed hosts that would otherwise be restricted",
	"details": "An issue was found in the redirect_uri validation logic that allows for a bypass of otherwise explicitly allowed hosts.\n\nThe problem arises in the verifyRedirectUri method, which attempts to enforce rules on user-controllable input, but essentially causes a desynchronization in how Keycloak and browsers interpret URLs. Keycloak, for example, receives \"[www%2ekeycloak%2eorg%2fapp%2f:y@example.com](https://www%2ekeycloak%2eorg%2fapp%2f:y@example.com/)\" and thinks the authority to be keycloak.org when it is actually example.com. This happens because the validation logic is performed on a URL decoded version, which no longer represents the original input.\n\n### Acknowledgements\nKarel Knibbe ",
